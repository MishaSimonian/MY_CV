# Misha Simonian CV

Welcome to my professional CV! I’m a Junior Java Developer with a strong foundation in Core Java (OOP, collections, streams, multithreading) and hands-on experience in building backend applications, such as a Patient Management System using Java and Spring Boot. I’m currently enhancing my skills in JDBC, REST APIs, and design patterns while transitioning from front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to backend development.
